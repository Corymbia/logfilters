logfilters
==========

This repo contains a simple flat text file containing useful Eucalypus log messages for use with filters in log-watching and monitoring systems.  If you're using Logstash, Graylog or Splunk-like like mechanism to analyse logs then these filters are a useful starting point for picking up activities in the cloud (such as an instance launch, or a node failure).
